# ✅ Day 1 of My AI Engineering Journey – Getting Hands-On with GPT-35-Turbo

Today marked the beginning of my AI engineering journey, and what an exciting start it has been! 🚀

I explored practical tools like Google Colab and Jupyter Notebook, and began building real-world applications using Azure OpenAI’s GPT-35-Turbo with Python.

## 🧰 Tools I Explored:

Google Colab – Great for quick experimentation with Python and zero setup

Jupyter Notebook – Perfect for step-by-step code + explanation + output

## 🤖 What I Built with Azure OpenAI + Python:

- Basic prompts and completions
- Prompt customization with temperature, max_tokens, and number of responses 
- Response analyzer using spaCy to extract tokens and named entities 
- Follow-up prompts based on location entities 
- Context-aware chatbot that remembers conversation history 
- Article generator and summarizer 
- Sentiment analysis from text input 
- Text classification 
- Multilingual text translation

## 💡 My Takeaway:

```
“The moment you move from reading about AI to building with it, everything changes.”
```

#### This is just Day 1, and I’m super excited to keep learning, building, and sharing more.
##### Let’s grow together! 💬
